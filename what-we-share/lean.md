# Lean Software Development

## 1. Introduction
- Everything should be Just-in-Time
- Eliminate `waste` (Muda, in Japanese - 無駄)
- There are some ways to PRACTICE - however, it is more like a philosophy
- A quick summary - go to [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development)

## 1.1 What is WASTE
- Anything cannot add value to the customers
- PURE waste vs Necessary waste

## 2. Lean principles

1. Eliminate waste
2. Amplify learning
3. Decide as late as possible
4. Deliver as fast as possible
5. Empower the team
6. Build integrity in
7. Optimize the whole

## 3. Typical waste in software development

1. Partially done work - Get things DONE
2. Extra features - Go with verified ones
3. Relearning - Revisit and do small
4. Task switching - No multitasking
5. Waiting - Human waiting is a PURE waste
6. Handoffs
7. Defects - Do better Quality Assurance, which is a necessary waste
8. Management activities - Be avoid to actively track the statuses

## 4. Practices (some are grouped into SCRUM)
1. Eliminate waste (see above)
2. Value stream mapping - Visualize the software development process
3. Set-based development - Instead of a definite POINT-based, try to provide a range for better coordination
4. Pull systems - NO HARD schedule
5. Queueing theory
6. Motivation
7. Measurements
8. Test-driven development

## 5. Questions
- Just-In-Time to prevent `overproduction` is GOOD, how about `under-production`? Need to align
- Eliminate waste is the core concept on Lean, but waste does not produce values?
- The boundary of necessary waste?
- The stakeholder can delay the decision making ONLY IF the system is FLEXIBLE. Flexbility introduces complexity. Who and by What to decide?
- Who is coordinating it?
