# UI UX Designer Challenge

## User Story

As a construction inspector, I need a photo management application to help my daily tasks

- When I am at the construction site, I want to use a photo management `mobile` app to take site photos and find some relevant photos to compare with the sites
- When I am in the office, I want a web based application to manage the photos, add proper descriptions and share to my colleagues and external subcontractors
