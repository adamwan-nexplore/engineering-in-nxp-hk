   https://{DOMAIN}/api (Swagger Documentation)
   
2. Generate locally

   A json file will be generated in openapi/swagger.spec.json

## Naming convention
- All modules are in plural form. 
- Except `src/migrations`, all file names should be in lowercase, and with `-` as the delimiter between words
- All entities should be in singular form and put under `entities` folders
- Due to the conventions in `TypeORM`, the file names in `src/migrations` will be `{TIME-STAMP}-{MigrationName}`, where `MigrationName` will be Pascalcase.
