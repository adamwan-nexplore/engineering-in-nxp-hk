## Philosophy

1. [Boy/Girl-scout Engineer](https://www.stepsize.com/blog/how-to-be-an-effective-boy-girl-scout-engineer)

    `Always leave the code better than you found it`

    You should consider tidy up the code at the same time you submit a change.

    Like
    - extract constants
    - extract enums
    - name some complicated anonymous functions
    - leave some application log
    - tidy up the content of application log

2. Deliver your change with quality and confidence

    `Write more pure functions and automated tests`

    - `functions` expects that inputs and outputs are always present.
    - `pure` describes a function that is no change to `non-inputs`. In JS/TS, be aware of `Promise` and `async/await`, reading current time, or generating a random stuff.
