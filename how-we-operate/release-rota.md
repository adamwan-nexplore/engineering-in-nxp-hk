# Continuous Delivery & Release Rota

## Continuous Delivery
> Continuous Delivery is achieved by working so that our software is always in a releasable state
> - Quote from Continuous Delivery Pipelines

## Old School Jargons

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Continuous Exploration

### Practical Considerations

We can simply define the whole processes by two parts
- Continuous Delivery Pipelines
    - Machine handling all the repeated tasks
- Release ROTA
    - The person compensates on non-repeated tasks and irregular blockers

The important elements of Continous Delivery are
- Lean Mentality
- Agile Practices
-> DevOps Culture

- The practices are Delivery Pipelines (Machines)
- Is a workflow to delivery a Qualified Software to Users
- Some parts can be automated by machine, it often provides FAST, repeatable, standardized and unified response
- We use Microsoft Teams (ChatOps) as our uniformed platfrom to aggregate it
- Some parts require human involvement, it is often more flexible, complicated and mirror the reality

### What kinds of pipelines we should have

Two Important Pipelines

- Explore the needs & Extract data for further development (Continuous Exploration)
- Lint / Test + Build + Publish (Continuous Integration) + Deploy (Continuous Deployment)

To reduce the lead time and get the feedback as fast as possible, chanage has published should be visiable in actual environments (either, development, test or production)

## Release Rota

The only meaningful definition of done to us is to delivery the features to ACTUAL users

There are many cases to cause the delivery blocking
- Bugs
- Vulnerability Update
- Database Migration failed

- Although we have a variety of components to detect those
    - Daily Regular Build
    - Automated Test Cases
    - Automated Data Migration Tests
    - Realtime Monitoring on Production Environments
    - Code Review from Peers
- We might probably need further investigation, confirmation and deployment to promote the features
- That is why we have release manager to focus on those stuff.

- Dedicated to review the issues from APM, Pipelines sit in ChatOps
- Once issues appeared and blocked the delivery flow, make sure engineer responsibles aware of those and fix those ASAP
- A diffused responsiblitiy of Release Manager, every engineer should take part of it on ROTA
